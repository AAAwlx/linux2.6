/*
 * Called with tasklist_lock held for writing.
 * Unlink a traced task, and clean it up if it was a traced zombie.
 * Return true if it needs to be reaped with release_task().
 * (We can't call release_task() here because we already hold tasklist_lock.)
 *
 * If it's a zombie, our attachedness prevented normal parent notification
 * or self-reaping.  Do notification now if it would have happened earlier.
 * If it should reap itself, return true.
 *
 * If it's our own child, there is no notification to do. But if our normal
 * children self-reap, then this child was prevented by ptrace and we must
 * reap it now, in that case we must also wake up sub-threads sleeping in
 * do_wait().
